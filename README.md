## <b>ü§î Can you tell me briefly about this resource?</b>
Using this resource, you'll be able to set your server as a Discord activity for every online player in your server (for ones who chose to enable their activity on their Discord profile settings)

## <b>‚öôÔ∏è Great! What dependencies do i need?</b>
In order to use this resource, you'll need:
- Nothing! Just a running server!

## <b>‚ùì Ok.. but how do i use it?</b>
1. Download the resource and put it inside of your resources list.
2. Go to [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
3. Create a new application.
4. Copy the application ID. (under **TAGS** in **General Information** tab)
5. At the left-sided menu click on **Rich Presence > Art Assets**
6. Add 2 assets: 1 as the big asset (Blue asset in the preview) and 2nd for the small one (Red asset in the preview). <br />
The names of the assets that you have uploaded will use as a reference later on in the resource. <br />
For example `devbig` and `devsmall` in the resource config.
7. Go into the config of the resource and edit the information. (`DiscordAppID`, `AppBigAssetID`, `AppSmallAssetID`)
8. Edit the other information at the config as you wish.
9. Simply add ``ensure fs_discord_presence`` inside your ``server.cfg``

If you have done that correctly - Congratulations! You got the resource working properly!

## <b>üÜò Wait.. But what if i need help?</b>
